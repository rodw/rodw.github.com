        <li><b><a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/gvpr-mode/">gvpr-mode</a></b> a simple emacs lisp major mode for working with gvpr, Graphviz's graph pattern recognizer.

      <p>You can probably find more on <a href="https://github.com/rodw">my GitHub&nbsp;page</a>.</p>

    <div class="mmtop align-both">
      <h2 class="mtop align-center remove-bottom">CoffeeScript</h2>
      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>I did a fair bit of work with <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> ("a little language that compiles into JavaScript") and server-side JavaScript under <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> not so long ago. Here are some modules I've posted on&nbsp;GitHub.</div>
      <ul class="square">
        <!-- <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/pandox">pandox</a></b> is an implementation of the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> filter API in JavaScript/CoffeeScript</a>.</li> -->
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/stew">stew</a></b> is a JavaScript library that implements the complete <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html">CSS Selector</a> syntax, and extends it to add support for regular expressions in tag names, ids, class names, attribute names and attribute values. It is published on npm as <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/stew-select">stew-select</a>.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/phony">phony</a></b> is a library and command-line utility that generates fake but realistic-looking names, addresses, text, email addresses, etc. for testing, demonstration or random inspiration.  It is availble on npm as <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/phony">phony</a>.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/named-parameters">named-parameters</a></b> is a utility that makes it easier to write JavaScript/CoffeeScript methods that accept maps as arguments (rather than arrays).  Think <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-optimist/">node-optimist</a>, but for function arguments rather than command line parameters. It is available as an npm package at <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/named-parameters">named-parameters</a>.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/tiny-node.js-webserver">tiny-node.js-webserver</a></b> does what it says on the tin: a simple web server implemented in a single small CoffeeScript file.</li>

      <h2 class="mtop align-center remove-bottom">Brightspoke, a search engine for bikes.</h2>
      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>The last time I was on the market for a new bicycle I created <a href="http://www.brightspoke.com/">a tool for comparing bikes</a> that I think is pretty nifty. The bike data is now stale, but the <a href="http://www.brightspoke.com/t/bike-stem-calculator.html">stem fit calculator</a> remains popular. The calculator can help you determine how your handlebars will move when you change your stem. (The stem being the bit on a bike that connects the handlebars to the fork.)</div>

      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>People tell me I should write a book. No, seriously, they really do. I'd like to think that's because I like to take a deep-dive into relatively esoteric topics, but it probably means I'm just opinionated or pontificate too much. I've actually got a couple of drafts going:</div>

      <h2 class="mtop align-center remove-bottom">The Axion RDMS</h2>
      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <p>Once upon a time I created a fully-functional relational database from scratch (with more than a bit of help from collaborators). I was a major developer behind <a href="http://axion.tigris.org/">Axion</a>, a small, fast, open source relational database system written in and for Java.  Axion has been dormant for quite a while, but it was and still is a fairly robust and complete system. Axion had and as far as I know still has some features no other RDBMS provides. Axion...</p>
      <ul class="square">
        <li>is embedded (it runs in-process within the same JVM as the client code),</li>
        <li>supports both persitent (on-disk) and transient (in-memory) modes,</li>
        <li>supports both ANSI SQL and several extensions from Oracle's SQL dialect (circa 10g or whatever was released at the time),</li>
        <li>is fully transactional,</li>
        <li>is fully ACID (providing <i>A</i>tomicity, <i>C</i>onsistency and <i>I</i>solation and <i>D</i>urability),</li>
        <li>can be easily extended with custom "pluggable" table, index, column (field) and function types.</li>
        <li>can be found in commercial products containing millions of rows and gigabytes of data, processing thousands of transactions per second (while not a toy database by any standards, this certainly isn't "big data" volumes, but bear in mind that this was 10-15 years ago on what even then were low-end consumer models).</li>
        <li>was nominated as a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki/?ProgramsToRead"><i>Program to Read</i></a> on the venerable <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki">C2 Wiki</a> (a.k.a. "Ward's Wiki" or, notably, "the original wiki").
      </ul>
      <p>Building this wasn't as impractical as it might&nbsp;sound. The first version of Axion was created by a tiny team in less than 5 months in support of a top-selling, award-winning, shrink-wrapped retail CD/DVD-ROM product, and was successfully used in support of that product for nearly a&nbsp;decade.</p>

      <h2 class="mtop align-center remove-bottom">Apache</h2>
      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>I used to be quite active in the Java corners of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.  I had a pretty big role the creation of Jakarta-Commons (which eventually morphed into Apache-Commons) and a lesser role in the founding of the <a href="http://db.apache.org/">Apache DB</a> project. A fair bit of my code can still be found in the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/">Apache Commons</a> and (through a number of migrations of HttpClient) in <a href="http://hc.apache.org/">HttpComponents</a>, among other places.</div>
