      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>I've enjoyed working with CoffeeScript (Node.js) recently. Here are some modules I've posted on&nbsp;GitHub.</div>
      <ul class="square">
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/named-parameters">named-parameters</a></b> is an <a href="http://search.npmjs.org/#/named-parameters">npm module</a> that makes it easier to write JavaScript/CoffeeScript methods that accept maps as arguments (rather than arrays).  Think <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-optimist/">node-optimist</a>, but for function arguments rather than command line parameters.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/phony">phony</a></b> is an <a href="http://search.npmjs.org/#/phony">npm module</a> that generates realistic-looking fake names, addresses, text, email addresses, etc. for testing, demonstration or random inspiration.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/tiny-node.js-webserver">tiny-node.js-webserver</a></b> does what it says on the tin: a simple web server implemented in a single small CoffeeScript file.</li>

      <h2 class="mtop align-center remove-bottom">The Axion RDMS</h2>
      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <p>Once upon a time I created a fully-functional relational database from scratch (with a bit of help from collaborators). I was the primary developer behind <a href="http://axion.tigris.org/">Axion</a>, a small, fast, open source relational database system written in and for Java.  Axion has been dormant for quite a while, but it was and still is a fairly robust and complete system. Axion had and as far as I know still has some features no other RDBMS provides. Axion...</p>
      <ul class="square">
        <li>is embedded (it runs in-process within the same JVM as the client code),</li>  
        <li>supports both persitent (on-disk) and transient (in-memory) modes,</li>
        <li>supports both ANSI SQL and several extensions from Oracle's SQL dialect (circa 10g or whatever was released at the time),</li>
        <li>is fully transactional,</li>
        <li>is fully ACID (providing <i>A</i>tomicity, <i>C</i>onsistency and <i>I</i>solation and <i>D</i>urability),</li>
        <li>can be easily extended with custom "pluggable" table, index, column (field) and function types.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Building this wasn't as crazy or impractical as it might&nbsp;sound.</p>

      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>Some of my other repos on GitHub:</div>
      <ul class="square">
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/paper-forms">paper-forms</a></b> is a set of printable forms, templates and&nbsp;worksheets.</li>  
        <li><b><a href="https://github.com/rodw/git-add-ons">git-add-ons</a></b> contains some simple scripts for working with Git and&nbsp;GitHub.</li>

      <h2 class="mtop align-center remove-bottom">Apache</h2>
      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>I used to be quite active in the Java corners of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a>.  I had a pretty big role the creation of Jakarta-Commons (which eventually morphed into Apache-Commons) and a lesser role in the founding of the <a href="http://db.apache.org/">Apache DB</a> project. A fair bit of my code can still be found in the <a href="http://commons.apache.org/">Apache Commons</a> and (through an number of migrations of HttpClient) in <a href="http://hc.apache.org/">HttpComponents</a>, among other places.</div>

      <h2 class="mtop align-center remove-bottom">Brightspoke, a search engine for bikes.</h2>
      <hr class="half-bottom remove-top"/>
      <div>The last time I was on the market for a new bicycle I created <a href="http://www.brightspoke.com/">a tool for comparing bikes</a> that I think is pretty nifty. The bike data is now stale, but the <a href="http://www.brightspoke.com/t/bike-stem-calculator.html">stem fit calculator</a> remains popular. The calculator can help you determine how your handlebars will move when you change your stem. (The stem being the bit on a bike that connects the handlebars to the fork.)</div>
