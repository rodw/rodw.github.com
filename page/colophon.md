* The "braindump" icon was derived from ["memory"](http://thenounproject.com/noun/memory/) by Andrew J. Young, from [The Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com/).

* The monochrome GitHub and LinkedIn icons were derived from Alex Peattie's [JustVector Social Icons](http://www.alexpeattie.com/projects/justvector_icons) suite.

* This site is primarily built with [Skeleton CSS](http://www.getskeleton.com/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) (and minor extensions thereof).
