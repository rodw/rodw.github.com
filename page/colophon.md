* The "braindump" icon was derived from ["memory"](http://thenounproject.com/noun/memory/) by Andrew J. Young, from [The Noun Project](http://www.thenounproject.com/).

* The monochrome GitHub, LinkedIn and Twitter icons were derived from Alex Peattie's [JustVector Social Icons](http://www.alexpeattie.com/projects/justvector_icons) suite.

* The various StackExchange icons were derived from those distributed at [the StackExchange site](http://stackexchange.com/about/logos).

* The "no umlaut" icon is orignal work.
