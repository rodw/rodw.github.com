<p>
I&#39;m one of those people who&#39;s so obsessed with organization that he&#39;s poorly organized.  I&#39;m constantly trying out new ways to manage the notes I scribble on various physical and electronic media, so much so that the frequency of change leads to greater disorganization.
</p><p>
I&#39;ve tried a number of &quot;information management&quot; tools, including index cards, sticky notes, notebooks, a Franklin planner, Microsoft Outlook, and various outlining, mind-mapping and PIM programs, and found them all wanting in one way or another (maybe it&#39;s me).  Paper based systems were too hard to search and too static in their organization.  Lacking a PDA, electronic systems weren&#39;t portable enough.  No matter what the system, I&#39;d always spend more time trying to set up organizational categories than I ever saved by using them. In fact I had pretty much broken the habit, falling back to a collection of loosely organized text files that I could easily scp to and from whatever workstation I was currently using.
</p><p>
About a year ago, I got a Sharp Zaurus, and since that addresses one of my recurring PIM complaints--having something that&#39;s always readily available, my hopes for finding the perfect PIM system were renewed.  I&#39;ve played around with a number of the PIM systems available.  Using the bundled Address Book/Calendar/To Do List/Email Client was too jumbled.  The &quot;outliner&quot; <a href="http://iqnotes.kybu.sk/?page=index">IQNotes</a> was promising, but a single hierarchy is inflexible and using it to create dated journal entries requires too much manual effort.  In the end, I came back to a loosely organized collection of text files, this time stored on the Zaurus.
</p><p>
Back in my <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/03/28.html#a3" title="28 March 2003: First Post">first post</a>, I mentioned that one of the reasons I was interested in blogging is that I had become interested in journaling in general.  These two concepts--the search for the perfect organizational system and interest in journaling--interrelate.
</p><p>
As I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the first to suggest, it seems that the ideal PIM system presents at least two perspectives on the information to be managed:
</p><p>
1) A time based view, answering such questions as &quot;what have I been working with recently?&quot; or &quot;what else was I working on around that time?&quot;
</p><p>
2) A &quot;concept network&quot; view, answering such questions as &quot;what&#39;s related to this topic?&quot; or &quot;what else do I know about this subject?&quot;
</p><p>
Clearly, I presume, blog-like software is an excellent starting point for the former, and wiki-like software is an excellent starting point for the former.  Fortunately, a number of projects have begun to explore combinations of the two, either by implementing a blog-as-wiki (like <a href="http://snipsnap.org/" title="snipsnap.org">SnipSnap</a> does) or by adding blogging features to a wiki engine (like <a href="http://www.jspwiki.org/" title="jspwiki.org">JspWiki</a> and no doubt others do).
</p><p>
Having a fair amount of Java experience (indeed, I&#39;ve built a little wiki or two in Java), my first thought was to get a Java based wiki up and running on my Zaurus.  JspWiki looks nice, and like most Java-based wikis is Servlet/JSP based, so I endeavored to get a WAR-friendly Java Servlet engine up and running on my Zaurus.  Having tried both Tomcat and Jetty under both the <a href="http://www.esmertec.com/products/products_jeode.shtm" title="Jeode Java Runtime Environment">Jeode evm</a> and <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/pp4zaurus/" title="J2ME Personal Profile for Zaurus">Personal Java cvm</a>, I came close, but fundamentally failed to do this.  (I note that my SL-5500 had just barely enough disk space or memory to do this as well.)
</p><p>
I briefly considered setting up a stand-alone (i.e., non-Servlet/JSP) Java wiki engine on the Zaurus, but without a moderate amount of development that seems like an awkward environment for templating and modification, and non-servlet Java web development feels like dead-end development. (Its only a matter of time before a reasonably micro servlet engine is available.)  That&#39;s when I stumbled across <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PhlIp" title="Ward's Wiki: PhlIp">PhlIp</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.xpsd.com/MiniRubyWiki" title="XpSD Wiki: Mini Ruby Wiki">Mini Ruby Wiki</a>, which implements a featureful, stand-alone wiki server in around 1000 lines of Ruby code.
</p><p>
(For the record, one could readily build a similarly featured wiki in Java, and probably a number of languages, in roughly the same number of lines, it might not be as much fun.)
</p><p>
It still took me a while to get a Ruby interpreter up and running on the Zaurus (after trying a few different builds, I finally got the one from <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/46111" title="Re: Ruby on the Sharp Zaurus PDA">Vincent Fiack</a> working), but the resulting binaries are smaller in terms of disk and memory footprint than the JVMs I was playing with.  Perhaps more importantly, as a purely interpreted language, the engine itself is easier to tweak.  And this gives me a reasonably good excuse to hack out some Ruby code.  I&#39;ve already added/modified a few minor features, adding some simple blog-like features to the calendar features that already existed.  If I come up with something I&#39;m not to embarrassed to share, I&#39;ll post it here or submit it to PhlIp&#39;s <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/minirubywiki" title="RubyForge: Project Info: MiniRubyWiki">RubyForge</a> project.
</p><p>
My only problem now is resisting the temptation to continually tweak the wiki engine code.
