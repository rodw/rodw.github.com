In a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/06/24.html#a34" title="24 June 2003: Testing Testing">previous post</a> I alluded to the use of mutation testing to evaluate the completeness of a test suite, rather than relying upon pure test coverage metrics.  In a <a href="http://radiocomments2.userland.com/comments?u=122027&amp;p=34" title="comments on &quot;Testing Testing&quot;">comment</a> to that post <a href="http://www.oshineye.com/" title="Adewale Oshineye's homepage">Adewale Oshineye</a> suggested that I check out Ivan Moore&#39;s <a href="http://jester.sourceforge.net/" title="Jester: the JUnit test tester">Jester</a>, a Java/JUnit based mutation testing tool.  I&#39;d seen Jester before, but I&#39;d never used it nor looked at it in much detail.  The anecdote about <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/32277" title="jester shows bowling scoring could be simpler">what Jester uncovered</a> in Bob Martin&#39;s and Robert Koss&#39;s <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/xpepisode.htm" title="Engineer Notebook: An Extreme Programming Episode">test driven bowling score calculator example</a> was certainly interesting, so this morning I bit the bullet and downloaded a copy.
</p><p>
Getting Jester up and running was a minor hassle (and it seems like much of that hassle could be alleviated), but I&#39;ve written my share of open source projects with quirky configuration and installation, so I&#39;ll leave that alone.  Once my files were placed in the proper position and after tweaking the python scripts to get them to run on whatever version of python I&#39;ve got on my RedHat box, Jester ran slowly (waiting on javac) but well.  It ran much faster once I figured out how to tell Jester to stop mutating my comments (set <code>shouldRemoveComments=true</code> in <code>jester.cfg</code>).  The result was a basic HTML report like <a href="http://jester.sourceforge.net/jester.html" title="example Jester report">this one</a>.
</p><p>
(On an unrelated note, is there something more or less equivalent to <code>python -version</code>?)
</p><p>
As an experiment, I took a small component (196 non-blank, non-comment lines of code spread over 34 methods) I knew to be well tested (100% coverage of statements and conditional expressions) and ran it through Jester.  It found 21 mutations total, 2 of which didn&#39;t lead to a test failure.  Those were (with the modified code in bold):
</p>
<pre>if(<b>TRUE ||</b> MESSAGE_LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
   MESSAGE_LOG.debug(&quot;Broadcasting &quot; + msg);
}</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>List list = new ArrayList(_listeners.size() + <b><strike>1</strike>2</b>);
list.addAll(_listeners);
list.add(<i>...</i>);</pre>
<p>
In the first case, believe it or not, I actually had unit tests that confirm that MESSAGE_LOG generates log events when set to the DEBUG priority, and no log events when set to higher than DEBUG priority.  (I wouldn&#39;t normally do that, except this is the single log message in that component, and I really wanted 100% coverage.  Besides, it wasn&#39;t that hard, I just added a mock Appender to that Category, and checked to see if a message was added or not.)  Of course, both of these tests still pass, even without the isDebugEnabled call, since the debug method won&#39;t generate a log event when using a higher priority.  Adding a test that fails as a result of this mutation isn&#39;t particularly useful, but it isn&#39;t difficult either--I just pass in a mock instance of the <i>msg</i> object and check whether or not the toString method is invoked.  Not invoking toString is indeed the reason for this if(isDebugEnabled()) block, so maybe that&#39;s not such an odd test to have after all.
</p><p>
The second case is the kind of thing Ivan Moore describes as a &quot;false positive&quot; in his <a href="http://www.xp2001.org/xp2001/conference/papers/Chapter20-Moore.pdf" title="Jester - a JUnit test tester">writeup on Jester</a>.  This code initializes that ArrayList to the precise size it knows will need.  Allocating it a little bit bigger or a little bit smaller doesn&#39;t alter the functional behavior of the method (although it will be slightly less efficient).  Maybe that indicates a premature optimization on my part, but it seems like a pretty small one.  In any event I don&#39;t see any way to confirm that that List was allocated to precisely the right size without breaking encapsulation profoundly, so I think I&#39;ll let that one go.
</p><p>
I had hoped to run Jester on some larger, more complicated but less well tested code (3,287 nc,nb lines, roughly 77% coverage) to get a feel for how it works in a more useful scenario, but I&#39;ve been unable to get it to complete a run on the this larger component.  I may poke around with something in-between, but 4,000 lines is on the smallish side for the kinds of modules I&#39;d want to run this on.  I may have better luck mutating a single class at a time.
</p><p>
In short, I think Jester meets <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/" title="intertwingly.net: Sam Ruby's Weblog">Sam Ruby</a>&#39;s criteria for a successful open source project--it&#39;s a good idea with a bad implementation.  I have some thoughts on how to improve that implementation (mainly obvious ones--e.g., use a ClassLoader and an actual parser, or consider mutating the byte code rather than the source) that maybe I&#39;ll cover in a later post.  All in all, Jester is an interesting project, and like a lot of things, I wish it worked a bit better.
