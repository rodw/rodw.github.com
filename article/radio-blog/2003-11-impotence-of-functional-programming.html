Sjoerd Visscher <a href="http://w3future.com/weblog/2003/11/11.xml#theImpotenceOfFunctionalProgramming" title="11 November 2003: The impotence of functional programming">writes</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>"Take for example the function zip (or zip3, zip4, exponential ugh-ness), a very popular function in f.e. Haskell. Firstly, if you have two lists, with values that go pairwise together, those values shouldn't have been apart in the first place. Secondly, what you end up with is a list of tuples. Values in a tuple always have more context than just being together. All this information is lost."</blockquote>
