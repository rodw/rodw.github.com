Recently I realized that I've almost subconsciously been following a design heuristic that even I found surprising--I avoid concrete parent classes.  Since coming to this realization, I've been struggling (and failing) to come up with a good case for an instantiable parent class.  Is there a case for classes that are neither abstract nor final?  Could concrete parent classes be a code smell?
