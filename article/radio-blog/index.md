## from Rod's Old Radio UserLand Blog

Back in 2003 I ran [a moderately popular tech blog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/) on the Radio UserLand platform.

While weblogs.com has continued to serve the content for more than 10 years after I stopped paying them to, I thought that for posterity's sake it might be a good idea to migrate those posts to a site I actually have control of.

Notes:

1. This archive only contains the text of the blog posts themselves.  Comments and trackbacks (which Radio hosted on another server) disappeared a long time ago.

2. Items that aren't linked haven't been ported over yet.

3. Bold text indicates popular and/or "meatier" posts.

4. The process of migrating from the weblogs.com site to here was semi-automated, so I haven't looked at each post in detail.  If you come across broken links or other obvious translation errors, please let me know (my contact info is in the footer).

So without further adieu, here's a list of the posts from that blog:
