<div style="color:#333">(Back in 2003 I ran <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/">a moderately popular tech blog</a> on the Radio UserLand platform.

I started a little page that describes some of the tricks this neophyte Radio Userland user has learned.  I'm calling the first non-trivial one (although it's pretty close to trivial) <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/stories/2003/04/11/radioTidbits.html#waypathit" title="Radio Tidbits: Waypath It">Waypath It</a>, and it generates links that search <a href="http://waypath.com/" title="waypath.com">waypath.com</a> for related blog entries, much like the <a href="http://radio.userland.com/googleItMacro" title="New feature: Google-It! Macro for Item Templates">Google It macro</a> does for Google.<p>

The full story is <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/stories/2003/04/11/radioTidbits.html" title="Radio Tidbits">here</a>.
