I have to give a product demo this morning.  Although I hope I don't need to use it today, I'm reminded of a little joke I used to tell back in my consulting days to keep the customer occupied when a problem forced me to do an unexpected restart, reboot or reinstall in the midst of a demonstration:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A chemist, a physicist and a computer scientist were traveling in a car when the engine suddenly puttered out and they were forced to pull over to the side of the road.</p>
<p>"We must be out of fuel", the chemist said, "but I just saw a gas station.  I'll walk back and pick some up."</p>
<p>"No, no", said the physicist, "that clearly sounded like a mechanical problem.  Let me pop the hood and take a look."</p>
<p>"Wait!", said the computer scientist. "I have an idea.  Let's all get out of the car&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and then get back in."</p>
</blockquote>
