<div style="color:#333">(Back in 2003 I ran <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/">a moderately popular tech blog</a> on the Radio UserLand platform.  This is an archived version of a post from that blog. You can view <a href="/article/radio-blog/index.html">an index of all the archived posts</a>.)</div><hr>

John Wiseman <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/000390.html" title="Lemonodor: April 09, 2003: The Hundred Year Language">points out</a> that Paul Graham has written up a version of his PyCon keynote address on
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">"The Hundred Year Language"</a>.  <p>

This is the address that was summarized in <a href="http://mindview.net/WebLog">Bruce Eckel's weblog</a>, as I <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/04/03.html#a9" title="Rod Waldhoff's Weblog: April 03, 2003: Bruce Eckel has an interesting blog">previously mentioned</a>.</p><p>

I'd pull quotes, but it's really an good read all the way through if you're at all interested in language design or evolution. (And nearly any program design really is language design.)</p><p>
