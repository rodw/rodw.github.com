I work for a company that at one time tried to position itself as a "dot com" and as a result I've seen a lot of friends and colleagues come and go over the years.  This inevitably results in a "farewell" email of one form or another.  For reasons both morbid and practical I archived many of these emails.  I named this mail folder "I quit", although it might more accurately be named "I've been laid off".  I find the variety of length, content, and tone fascinating.  Some are short but sincere: "It has been a privilege (and a blast) working with you, but I am moving on..."  Others are business-like and more than a little bitter: "As of [date] I will be resigning from my position as [title] of [department]."  Others strive to be poetic: "...and so castles made of sand, fall in the sea, eventually."  Others wax philosophical: "I imagine it was probably a dreich, sodden morning as two gentlemen nervously paced the stony, moss-covered steps..."

Going through my mail yesterday afternoon, I had a sensation while flipping through the April 18th edition of <a href="http://infoworld.com/" title="infoworld.com">InfoWorld</a> magazine similar to the one I have when looking through my "I quit" archive.  It seems that InfoWorld is changing formats a bit and has bid farewell to a number of its columnists.  I'm not a regular reader of InfoWorld, and probably couldn't identify any of its columnists by name, but <a href="http://infoworld.com/article/03/04/18/16survguide_1.html" title="Bob Lewis: Survival Guide: Parting thoughts">the</a>

You can see <a href="http://infoworld.com/col_hom.html">an index of InfoWorld columns</a> on their site, but it looks like that probably changes from month to month.
