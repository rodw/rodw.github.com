# Fixing checked exceptions with generics

<div style="color:#333">(Back in 2003 I ran <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/">a moderately popular tech blog</a> on the Radio UserLand platform.  This is an archived version of a post from that blog. You can view <a href="/articles/radio-blog/index.html">an index of all the archived posts</a>.)</div><hr>

[Matt Quail](http://madbean.com/blog/) [proposes](http://madbean.com/blog/15/) an interesting [generics](http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/14.jsp)-based solution to my [issues with checked exceptions in Java](http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/stories/2003/04/01/JavasCheckedExceptionsWereAMistake.html).
It's been a long time since I used templates (in C++), and I haven't looked at the [public review draft of JSR 14](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr014/index.html) in any detail, but it seems like something along those lines might work.

Someone calling himself [JavaBear](http://www.freeroller.net/page/javabear/) also had some [kind comments](http://www.freeroller.net/page/javabear/20030402#exception_handling_taking_back_one) regarding this post.
