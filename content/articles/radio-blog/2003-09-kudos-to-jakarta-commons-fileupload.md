# Kudos to Jakarta Commons FileUpload

<div style="color:#333">(Back in 2003 I ran <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/">a moderately popular tech blog</a> on the Radio UserLand platform.  This is an archived version of a post from that blog. You can view <a href="/articles/radio-blog/index.html">an index of all the archived posts</a>.)</div><hr>

Recently <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2003/09/13#580" title="Ted Leung: 13 Sep 2003: I don't want to read your damned source code">Ted</a> and <a href="http://www.freeroller.net/page/jdmarshall/20030912#disinterest_is_not_incompetence" title="Jason Marshall: 12 Sep 2003: Disinterest Is Not Incompetence">Jason</a> blogged on an old complaint: open source projects aren't well documented.
</p><p>
In a curious coincidence, at the same time I had an very positive experience with open source documentation.  Being a Jakarta Commons committer, and having done my share of multipart/form-data parsing in the past, I was vaguely familiar with <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/fileupload/" title="Apache's Jakarta Commons FileUpload">Commons FileUpload</a> but hadn't had much cause to look into it until recently.  Not only does it feature an easy-to-use API that works like a charm, the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/fileupload/using.html">Using FileUpload</a> page tells one everything he needs to know to get up and running in minutes.
</p>
Granted FileUpload addresses a pretty limited domain, and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/fileupload/customizing.html" title="Customizing FileUpload">not all the documentation is as complete</a>, but I can't remember the last time I picked up a Java library and started using it without even cracking open the JavaDocs.
