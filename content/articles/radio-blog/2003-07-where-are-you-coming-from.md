# Where are you all coming from?

<div style="color:#333">(Back in 2003 I ran <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/">a moderately popular tech blog</a> on the Radio UserLand platform.  This is an archived version of a post from that blog. You can view <a href="/articles/radio-blog/index.html">an index of all the archived posts</a>.)</div><hr>

  <p>
An unusually large number of my visitors today seem to be <a href="http://radio.xmlstoragesystem.com/rcsPublic/referers?site=0122027&amp;group=radio1" title="Referer rankings for Rod Waldhoff's Weblog">referred by</a> various email clients.  This and the number of direct hits (non-browser email clients?) are generating enough traffic to push this blog higher than usual in <a href="http://www.weblogs.com/rankingsByPageReads.html" title="UserLand Site Report: Rankings by Page Reads">UserLand's rankings of Radio sites</a>.
</p><p>
On other occasions the source of this sort of jump in traffic is <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/17/2257224" title="Slashdot.org: LGPL is Viral for Java">obvious</a>.  This time I can only assume a link went out on some mailing list, seemingly to <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/07/15.html" title="15 July 2003: my pet bug, or another example of how sun doesn't get community development">an older post</a>, but my ears are burning with curiosity.  Will someone post a comment indicating what list, if any, contained the link?
</p>
<p>UPDATE: JavaBlogs sucks.  This post isn't in either of my <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/categories/java/rss.xml">java</a> or <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/categories/tech/rss.xml">tech</a> feeds, and hence shouldn't have been picked up by the aggregator, but <a href="http://www.javablogs.com/ViewEntry.jspa?id=42640">there it is</a>.  Someone please tell me how to get JavaBlogs to pay attention to the proper feed. (Cf. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/04/16.html#a23" title="Ignore this post (Demonstrates javablogs bug?)">a previous post</a>.)
