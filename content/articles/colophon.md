# Colophon

[HeyRod.com](http://heyrod.com/) is a collection of static files served from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The "live" files are published to a git repository at [rodw/rodw.github.com](https://github.com/rodw/rodw.github.com/) on GitHub.

The published HTML, CSS, JS and related artifacts are generated by a custom "static site generator", which is [also available on GitHub](https://github.com/rodw/rodw.github.com/tree/source).

By and large, content is authored and stored in the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format.

These Markdown files are processed by [a small CoffeeScript program](https://github.com/rodw/rodw.github.com/blob/source/lib/scratch.coffee) custom-built for this purpose.

[chjj/marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) is used to parse and render the Markdown documents.

[j201/meta-marked](https://github.com/j201/meta-marked) is used to store "meta-data" such as tags directly within those Markdown files.

[akdubya/dustjs](http://akdubya.github.io/dustjs/) is used a templating engine to create the "boilerplate" content that wraps around the Markdown content.

The web design is based on the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework.

[Font-Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is used for the occasional icon or graphic flair.

[highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) provides syntax-coloring for source code listings.
