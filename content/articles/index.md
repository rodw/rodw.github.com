# Articles & Other Writing

I’ve started migrating some articles and other content that I’ve published elsewhere, and I’ll be adding the occasional new article now and then.

You could call this a “blog” but the writing tends to be long-form and published erratically so I’m sticking with the label “Articles” for now.

 * [How to develop a sourcing strategy.](/articles/how-to-develop-a-sourcing-strategy.html) - a six-step process for implementing a “strategic sourcing” framework.

 * [Archived posts from Rod’s old Radio blog](/articles/radio-blog/) - Back in 2003 I ran a moderately popular technology blog. This is an archive of posts from that blog.
