# The Graphviz Cookbook

I've been working on a how-to book about **[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)**, a powerful, open-source, graph visualization and processing framework.

***The Graphviz Cookbook***, like a regular cookbook, is meant to be a practical guide that shows you how to create something tangible and, hopefully, teaches you how to improvise your own creations using similar techniques.

The book is organized into four parts:
 
 * **Part 1: Getting Started** introduces the Graphviz tool suite and provides "quick start" instructions to help you get up-and-running wit Graphviz for the first time.

 * **Part 2: Ingredients** describes the elements of the Graphviz ecosystem in more detail, including an in-depth review of each application in the Graphviz family.
 
 * **Part 3: Techniques** reviews several idioms or "patterns" that crop up often when working with Graphviz such as how to tweak a graph's layout or add a "legend" to a graph. You might think of these as "micro-recipes" that are used again and again.
 
 * **Part 4: Recipes** contains detailed walk-throughs of how to accomplish specific tasks with Graphviz, such as how to spider a website to generate a sitemap or how to generate UML diagrams from source files.

You can download the following sample chapters (for personal use) in a PDF format:

 * **[Chapter 1: Graphviz in a nutshell](/files/gv-cookbook-chapter-01-sample-15343.pdf)** is an excerpt from Part 1 ("Getting Started").

 * **[Chapter 6: Section 7: patchwork](/files/gv-cookbook-chapter-06-sample-20343.pdf)** is an excerpt from Part 2 ("Ingredients").

 * **[Chapter 10: Using gvpr to style graphs](/files/gv-cookbook-chapter-10-sample-24343.pdf)** is an excerpt from Part 3 ("Techniques").

 * **[Chapter 26: A treemap of folder contents](/files/gv-cookbook-chapter-26-sample-40343.pdf)** is an excerpt from Part 4 ("Recipes").
